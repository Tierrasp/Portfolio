Navigating the site is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Upon arriving at the homepage, visitors are welcomed with a friendly greeting and an overview of the site's purpose. 
The main navigation menu at the top provides easy access to different sections such as "About," "Services," "Projects," and "Contact." 
As users scroll down, they can find detailed information about the site's offerings, including descriptions of skills, experiences, and notable projects.

To enhance user interaction, a chatbot has been seamlessly integrated into the site. 
This chatbot, implemented using Dialogflow's Web Demo integration, is embedded directly into the webpage. 
The integration process involved enabling the Web Demo in the Dialogflow console, copying the provided iframe code, and pasting it into the HTML of the site. 
The chatbot is designed to answer frequently asked questions about skills, experiences, and projects. 
It uses predefined intents and training phrases to understand user queries and provide relevant responses. 
This feature not only improves user engagement but also ensures that visitors can quickly find the information they need without navigating away from the page.
